Write a program that takes the 32 reserved words in C and stores them in a chained HASH table.  

Your program must also do the following:

    a) Read the data from an input file and store it in the HASH table.

    b) Have a search engine that finds a reserved word in the HASH table. You must demonstrate this with test cases.

    c) Produce a report for each non empty cell in the HASH table listing all reserved words that occur in that chain.

    d) Handle collisions!

    e) Provide several examples of output where the program executes with HASH table sizes which produce collisions, minimize collisions, etc.

    f) COMPLETE DOCUMENTING THE CODE provided for this exercise.

Extra credit will be given if you can devise an algorithm for this program that potentially handles collisions, but doesn't have any actual collisions during execution with the 32 reserved words.
