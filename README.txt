Problem 4
For both problems 4 and 5 you are to use the 32 reserved words in C. They can

be found on page 201 of the 1st edition and on page 629 of the 2nd edition 

of the textbook.

I will provide most of the code for these two exercises.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes the 32 reserved words in C and stores them in a chained HASH table. You can use the code provided as the basis for developing your program. Your program must also do the following:

    a) Read the data from an input file and store it in the HASH table.

    b) Have a search engine that finds a reserved word in the HASH table. You must demonstrate this with test cases.

    c) Produce a report for each non empty cell in the HASH table listing all reserved words that occur in that chain.

    d) Handle collisions!

    e) Provide several examples of output where the program executes with HASH table sizes which produce collisions, minimize collisions, etc.

    f) COMPLETE DOCUMENTING THE CODE provided for this exercise.

Extra credit will be given if you can devise an algorithm for this program that potentially handles collisions, but doesn't have any actual collisions during execution with the 32 reserved words.
